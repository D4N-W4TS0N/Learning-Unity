# Learning-Unity-and-Blender

I have published here the basic scripts you will need to start a unity game and also i will upload some Blender prefabs to be imported into unity.

if you click on "MouseLookAround", all you need to do is in the Unity inspector, link  playerBody to your player body but bare in mind yours may be called something different. the script allows the user to do full 
360 degree rotation with a 90 degree vertical clap so you cannot carry on looking up at a certain angle.

the blender files can be easily exported into Unity by: File >> Export >> Export as FBX >> then choose the assets folder of your Unity Project. However please bear in mind this may differ if you are using
the newer?older version of Blender/Unity. Make sure to highlight the objects you want to export, NOT the camera or light etc. Then, when choosing a folder to export to, click the box labeled "export highlited items" or
"highlited items".
Enjoy!!!!!
